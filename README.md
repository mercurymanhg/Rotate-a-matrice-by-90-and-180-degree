# Rotate-a-matrice-by-90-and-180-degree
Given a matrix of N*N dimensions (Mat). Print the matrix rotated by 90 degree and 180 degree.
Input
First line contains N.
N lines follow each containing N space seperated integers.

2 <= N <= 100
1 <= Mat[i][j] <= 10000
Output
Output 2*N+1 lines.
First N lines should contain the Matrix rotated by 90 degrees.
Then print a blank line.
Then N lines should contain the Matrix rotated by 180 degrees.
